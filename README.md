# Project---Public-Transit-Efficiency

**Objective**: public Transit Optimization is to conduct a comprehensive study on public transportation efficiency. This project aims to extract and analyze transportation data using SQL, identify patterns in usage, delays, and passenger satisfaction, and utilize Tableau for visualizing findings. The goal is to recommend areas for improvement in public transportation systems, fostering increased efficiency and enhancing the overall commuter experience.


**Key Findings:**
1.corridor Revenue Concentration: The top 5 corridors significantly drive fare revenue, prompting consideration of targeted promotions for less-utilized corridors.
2.Female Travel Dominance: Females are the primary travelers, with a uniform directional distribution, indicating widespread travel patterns.
3.Commencement and Conclusion Trends: Journeys often start at early stops and conclude at mid-range stops, suggesting passenger preferences for specific boarding and deboarding points.
4.Boarding and Deboarding Preferences: Initial and mid-range stops are frequently used for boarding and deboarding, emphasizing the importance of understanding passenger preferences at different points along the route.
5.Satisfaction Scores and Gender: Both male and female travelers express lower satisfaction scores, particularly clustering around a score of two, highlighting the need for improvements to enhance commuter satisfaction.
